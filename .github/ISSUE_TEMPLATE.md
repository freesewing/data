While I appreciate you are reporting an issue, here are some things to keep in mind:

**File your issue in the right place**

 - Problems with patterns are for the [core](https://github.com/freesewing/core/issues/new) repository
 - Website issues are for the [site](https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/new) repository
 - Problems with the data backend are for the [data](https://github.com/freesewing/data/issues/new) repository

**Provide relevant data**

This depends on what you're reporting, but useful info is:

 - Your username on the site
 - The hash of your draft
 - Any error message you may have received

**Give it a good title**

Be descriptive, because people who skim this list are more likely to turn
their attention to your issue if you give it a good title.
