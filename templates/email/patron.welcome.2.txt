Ahoy Patron!

Thank you for agreeing to be a Patron of Freesewing.

On behalf of myself and the entire freesewing community, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation that you have made this generous commitment.

So what happens now?

First and foremost, we are going to continue doing what we do. I think it is fair to assume that as our Patron, that is what you expect from us. If that makes you feel like you have made no difference, let me assure you: That is not the case.

Your commitment as a Patron is a great motivator for us. It tells us that what we do is worthwhile, and it is helps us secure a sustainable future for freesewing.org, our code, our patterns, and our community.

It is this, somewhat nebulous, dimension to your patronage which matters most. Becoming a Patron of Freesewing was an act of kindness and generosity on your behalf for which we can only offer our gratitude. We coudn't possibly repay you.


Thank you.
