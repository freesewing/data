Wow, you are awesome!

Thank you so much for joining the freesewing patrons as a First Mate. This is great news!

I'll be sending your gift in the mail soon, but before doing so I'll reach out to you to double-check your shipping address. 

Meanwhile, I've already added you to our list of patrons on freesewing.org.

Love,

joost

PS: If you are on Twitter, Instagram, or GitHub, please let me know so we can follow you from the official freesewing acccount. It's a patron's priviledge :)
