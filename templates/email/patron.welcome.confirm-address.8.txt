Wow, you are awesome!

Thank you so much for joining the freesewing patrons, as a Captain no less! This is great news.

First things first: we need some info.

As a Captain, we are going to need the following info from you:

  - Your shipping address (so we know where to send the booty)
  - Your birthday (day and month is all we need)


This is the shipping address we got from your payment:

__ADDRESS__


Please reply to this email to either confirm this is correct, or provide us with the correct address instead. Oh, and don't forget to include your birthday too.

Once you do that, I can send you a formal thank you note along with some of that much coveted booty.

Love,

joost
