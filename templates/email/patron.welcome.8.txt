Wow, you are awesome!

Thank you so much for joining the freesewing patrons, as a Captain no less! This is great news.


First things first: we need some info

As a Captain, we are going to need the following info from you:

 - Your shipping address (so we know where to send the booty)
 - Your birthday (day and month is all we need)

Please reply to this email with this information, so I can send you a formal thank you note.
